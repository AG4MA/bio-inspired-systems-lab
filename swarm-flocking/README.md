# Swarm Flocking

## Biological Summary
Flocking is the collective motion observed in birds, fish schools, and insect swarms. Craig Reynolds identified three simple rules that produce realistic flocking: separation (avoid crowding neighbors), alignment (steer toward average heading of neighbors), and cohesion (steer toward average position of neighbors). Each agent follows only local rules, yet the group exhibits coordinated, fluid motion.

## System Relevance
Flocking demonstrates how complex collective behavior emerges from simple local rules. No leader is required. The system is robust to agent loss and scales naturally. The three rules balance competing objectives: staying together, moving together, and not colliding.

## Applications
- Drone swarm coordination
- Robot formation control
- Crowd simulation in games/VFX
- Distributed sensor networks
- Traffic flow optimization
- Autonomous vehicle platoons
