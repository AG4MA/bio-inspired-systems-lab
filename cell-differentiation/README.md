# Cell Differentiation

## Biological Summary
Cell differentiation is the process by which identical cells become specialized for different functions. All cells share the same DNA, but local signals (morphogens, cell contacts, position) activate different gene expression programs. A stem cell can become a neuron, muscle cell, or skin cell based purely on its microenvironment. This creates complex tissues from homogeneous starting material.

## System Relevance
Cell differentiation shows how identical agents can assume different roles without central configuration. Agents self-organize into functional hierarchies based on local context. This enables dynamic role assignment, fault tolerance (any agent can become any role), and adaptation to changing requirements.

## Applications
- Dynamic role assignment in swarms
- Microservices that adapt function to load
- Self-configuring sensor networks
- Leaderless cluster management
- Adaptive drone team formation
- Serverless function specialization
