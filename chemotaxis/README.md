# Chemotaxis

## Biological Summary
Chemotaxis is the movement of organisms in response to chemical gradients. Bacteria like E. coli cannot directly sense the direction of a chemical source. Instead, they use a temporal comparison strategy: they move, measure if conditions improved or worsened, and adjust accordingly. This "run and tumble" behavior allows them to navigate toward attractants without a global map or compass.

## System Relevance
Chemotaxis demonstrates robust gradient-following without global knowledge. Agents only need local measurements and memory of recent states. This makes the algorithm resilient to noise, sensor errors, and dynamic environments. The stochastic nature prevents getting stuck in local optima.

## Applications
- Signal strength optimization (WiFi, radio)
- Reward gradient following in reinforcement learning
- Decentralized search and rescue operations
- Resource discovery in distributed systems
- Sensor network self-optimization
