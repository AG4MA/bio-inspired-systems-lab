# Slime Mold Pathfinding

## Biological Summary
Physarum polycephalum (slime mold) is a single-celled organism that forms networks to connect food sources. Despite having no brain, it finds near-optimal paths between points. It works by extending pseudopods in all directions, then reinforcing tubes where flow is high and pruning where flow is low. The result is an efficient transport network that rivals human-designed infrastructure.

## System Relevance
Slime mold demonstrates decentralized pathfinding that adapts to changing conditions. Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, it doesn't require a complete graph. It discovers paths through exploration and reinforcement, handles dynamic obstacles, and naturally load-balances across multiple routes.

## Applications
- Network routing optimization
- Decentralized logistics planning
- Dynamic infrastructure design
- Load-balanced communication networks
- Adaptive supply chain routing
- Self-healing network topologies
