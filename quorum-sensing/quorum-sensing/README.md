## Quorum Sensing

Quorum sensing is a biological phenomenon where microorganisms communicate and coordinate their behavior based on population density through the release and detection of signaling molecules. This process enables bacteria to synchronize activities such as biofilm formation, virulence, and bioluminescence, which are crucial for their survival and adaptation in complex environments.

In the context of complex systems, quorum sensing exemplifies how local interactions among agents can lead to emergent global behaviors. This principle is highly relevant to distributed software systems and artificial intelligence, where individual components must collaborate and adapt to achieve collective goals. By studying quorum sensing, we can derive insights into designing robust, scalable, and adaptive systems that mimic these natural processes. 

This module aims to explore the dynamics of quorum sensing through simulation, providing a framework for understanding how simple rules can lead to complex behaviors in both biological and computational systems.
