# Ant Foraging

## Biological Summary
Ants find optimal paths to food sources using pheromone trails. When an ant finds food, it returns to the nest depositing pheromones. Other ants preferentially follow stronger trails. Shorter paths get more traffic, thus more pheromone, creating positive feedback. Pheromone evaporation ensures old, suboptimal paths fade, enabling adaptation to changes.

## System Relevance
Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a proven metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization. Unlike slime mold (continuous exploration), ants work discretely on graph problems. The system naturally handles dynamic environments: when paths become blocked or food depletes, trails evaporate and new routes emerge.

## Applications
- Traveling salesman problem
- Vehicle routing optimization
- Network packet routing
- Job shop scheduling
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Real-time logistics planning
