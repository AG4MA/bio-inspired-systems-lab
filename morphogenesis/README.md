# Morphogenesis

## Biological Summary
Morphogenesis is the process by which organisms develop shape and structure. Alan Turing proposed that pattern formation arises from reaction-diffusion systems: two chemicals (morphogens) interact and diffuse at different rates, creating stable patterns like spots, stripes, and waves. This explains everything from zebra stripes to fingerprint patterns without requiring a blueprint.

## System Relevance
Morphogenesis demonstrates how complex spatial patterns emerge from simple local rules. No central planner dictates where spots or stripes go. Instead, local chemical interactions self-organize into coherent structures. This applies to any system needing distributed structure formation.

## Applications
- Sensor network deployment optimization
- Self-organizing node placement
- Distributed structure formation in robotics
- Procedural content generation
- IoT device topology design
- Emergent architecture in agent systems
