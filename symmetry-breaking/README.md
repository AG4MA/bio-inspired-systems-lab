# Symmetry Breaking

## Biological Summary
Symmetry breaking is how initially identical systems spontaneously choose a direction or state. A fertilized egg is symmetric but develops into an organism with distinct axes. Cells in a ring are identical, but one spontaneously becomes the leader. This occurs through positive feedback loops that amplify tiny random differences until one dominates.

## System Relevance
Symmetry breaking solves the "who goes first" problem without designated leaders. When all nodes are equal and must coordinate, symmetry breaking enables spontaneous role differentiation, leader election, and direction selection. It's fundamental to distributed consensus without pre-configuration.

## Applications
- Leaderless leader election
- Distributed consensus initiation
- Collective decision making
- Direction alignment in swarms
- Role assignment from identical nodes
- Spontaneous coordination startup
