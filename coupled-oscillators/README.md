# Coupled Oscillators

## Biological Summary
Fireflies synchronize their flashing without a conductor. Each firefly has an internal rhythm and adjusts it slightly when it sees others flash. Over time, thousands of fireflies across a forest end up flashing in unison. This emerges purely from local pulse-coupling: "when I see a flash, I speed up (or slow down) my own cycle slightly."

## System Relevance
Coupled oscillators solve distributed synchronization without a master clock. Each node has its own timer but couples to neighbors' timing. This creates robust, fault-tolerant coordination: if any node fails, others continue; if new nodes join, they quickly sync. No single point of failure.

## Applications
- Distributed clock synchronization
- Sensor network data collection timing
- Coordinated drone swarm actions
- Microservice heartbeat coordination
- Blockchain consensus timing
- Power grid phase synchronization
